# Flower Watering Game
A little game that I made using Pygame to familiarize myself with object oriented programming. Done in Python.

Current master branch is me experimenting writing the application without using objects at all. Other branches will be me writing the same application with the same functionalities, but having different data structures.

I do not own any of the images used in this project, they come from the internet.
